# Overview

Stormwind Library is developed in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) to serve as a framework for building World of Warcraft addons.

It basically works as a layer between the addon and the World of Warcraft API so...

* It can capture the game events and provide facades to simplify addon development
* It can wrap game information into objects to ease on the addon code readability and maintainability
* It can provide lots of helper functions for a variety of addon demands
