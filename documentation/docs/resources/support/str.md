# Str

The **Str** methods are focused on manipulating strings.

Each helper method is well documented in the support source code and won't
be duplicated here. Please, refer to the `./src/Support/Src.lua` for better
reference.

## Methods

* `Str:replaceAll()` - Replaces all occurrences of a substring in a string 
with another substring.
* `Str:split()` - Splits a string in a table by breaking it where the separator is found.
* `Str:trim()` - Removes all whitespace from the beginning and end of a 
string.
