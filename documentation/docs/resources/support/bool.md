# Bool

The **Bool** support methods are focused on working and validating bool 
values.

Each helper method is well documented in the support source code and won't
be duplicated here. Please, refer to the `./src/Support/Bool.lua` for better
reference.

## Methods

* `Bool:isTrue()` - Determines whether a value represents true or not.
