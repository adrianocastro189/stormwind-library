# Classes

Lua doesn't offer directly a class structure like every
OOP languages like PHP and Java. Because of that, there are
a couple of ways we can emulate classes and effectively be able to
instantiate objects that share logic, property, methods
structure, etc.

The Stormwind Library proposes a few standards to achieve
class structures that are created with a couple of metatables
settings and some indentation.

## Class standards

These are the standards used by Stormwind Library for a table to be
considered a class:

* Each class is defined in its own file, which is later merged to the
single library file
* All lines below the first `local` declaration are indented as
they belong to an opened structure
* Classes have a constructor similar to PHP's, called `__construct()`
* Due to how the library is compiled, when this "class" is being read by
the Lua compiler, the `self` calls are actually referencing the Library
instance, not the class being written -- **only the `self`'s inside
methods refer to the "class" itself**, and because of that, a `self:addClass()`
is called at the top, so the library can store a reference for this "class",
declared as `local`. After that, the library can instantiate that class
anywhere in the addon code.
    * Read the [factory documentation](factory) for more information

:::tip "Private" constructors

Sometimes it's recommended not to expose classes structures for free
instantiation. When that happens, simply don't call `self:addClass()`,
so `library:new()` won't have any effects on it, behaving as a private
constructor, when only the classes themselves can create their own
instances.

As an example, the [raid marker](../models/raid-marker) model has a
limited number of possible instances. That class can't be instantiated
by any addons and its instances are generated by the library during
its initialization.

:::tip Abstract methods

Abstract methods can be mimicked by creating a method that throws an
error when called. This way, the developer is forced to implement that
method in a child class. Example:

```lua
function AbstractClass:doSomething()
    error('This is an abstract method and should be implemented by this class inheritances')
end
```

## Class recipe

Use the recipe below to create new classes.

This is an example of a simple class with no properties.

```lua
--[[--
Class description.

@classmod Module.ClassName
]]
local ClassName = {}
    ClassName.__index = ClassName
    ClassName.__ = self
    self:addClass('ClassName', ClassName)

    --[[--
    ClassName constructor.
    ]]
    function ClassName.__construct()
        local self = setmetatable({}, ClassName)

        -- add properties here

        return self
    end
-- end of ClassName
```

And this is an example of the first test class version for the class above:

```lua
TestClassName = BaseTestClass:new()
    -- @covers ClassName:__construct()
    function TestClassName:testConstruct()
        local instance = __:new('ClassName', --[[ args here ]])

        lu.assertNotNil(instance)
    end
-- end of TestClassName
```

## Models

Please, refer to the [models documentation](../models/overview) for more
information on how to create models following the Stormwind Library standards.
