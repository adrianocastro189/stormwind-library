The Stormwind Library was structured with the following goals:

* **Versionable:** multiple addons running different library versions should not conflict.
* **Single built file:** a single built file is enough to import the library, just like a JavaScript
minified file.
* **Split source code logic:** the library source code is distributed in well organized files, with
their own responsibilities.
* **OOP development:** use as much as object oriented classes as possible to represent the game entities.
