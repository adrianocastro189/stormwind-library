# Lua Docs

Although the Stormwind Library is fully covered in this documentation page 
built over Docusaurus, the technical documentation is not well described
here, as its purpose is to provide a general overview of the library and
its features.

The technical documentation is intended to provide a more detailed view of
how methods and classes are implemented, as well as how they interact with
each other, what they expect and also their outputs.

For that reason, every method and property of the library should be covered
by Lua comments describing methods' signatures, parameters, and return
types.
