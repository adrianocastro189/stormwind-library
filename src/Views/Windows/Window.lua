The Window class is the base class for all windows in the library.

A window in this context is a standard frame that makes use of the World of
Warcraft CreateFrame function, but with some additional features: a title
bar that can move the window, a close button, a resize button at the bottom,
a content area with a scroll bar, plus a few other.

The motivation behind this class is to provide a simple way to create
windows, considering that the CreateFrame function is a bit cumbersome to
use, and that the standard window features can be enough for most addons.

It's necessary to note that this class is not as flexible as the CreateFrame
function, and that it's not meant to replace it. It's just a simple way to
create a basic window with some standard features. And if the addon developer
needs more flexibility, it's possible to extend this class to override some
methods and add new features.

    When built with an id and the library is created with the data property,
    the window will be capable to persist its position, size, and other user
    preferences.

                     information about the window, like its position and size
